# deno2node

`tsc` replacement for transpiling [Deno] libraries to run on [Node.js].

> **Note** You don't need this if you maintain a npm package Deno can already
> run: https://deno.land/manual/node

![Because Deno's tooling is way simpler than
Node's](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FBba11IXMAQB7pX?format=jpg)

## Quick Setup

Run `npx deno2node --init` in an empty directory.

> **Note** If you don't already have a `package.json`, you may find [`dnt`]
> easier to use.

## CLI Usage From Node.js

```sh
npm install -ED deno2node
npm pkg set scripts.prepare=deno2node
```

> **Note** New features or TypeScript upgrades may change output or diagnostics
> across minor versions of `deno2node`. Use `--save-prefix='~'` or
> `--save-exact` (`-E`) to avoid unexpected failures.

Create a [`tsconfig.json`] to specify `"compilerOptions"` and `"files"` to
`"include"`, if you don't have one already.

You can now invoke `deno2node` by running `npm run prepare`.

It will alse be executed automatically when you run `npm install`.

## CLI Usage From Deno

`deno2node` is actually a Deno project that compiles itself to run on Node.js.
(This is a great way to test the tool, too.)

```sh
deno run --no-prompt --allow-read=. --allow-write=. \
  https://deno.land/x/deno2node/src/cli.ts
```

## How It Works

There are three main steps to this.

1. Transform the code base in-memory, by rewriting all import statements.
2. Typecheck the code.
3. Emit `.js` and `.d.ts` files. These files can directly be run by Node or
   published on npm.

`deno2node` uses [`ts-morph`] under the hood, which in turn builds on top of the
TypeScript compiler `tsc`. Hence, you get the same behaviour as if you had
developed your code directly for Node.

`deno2node` can perform more powerful transpilation steps that make it flexible
enough for most needs.

### Shimming

Some things are global in Deno, but not in Node.js.

To rectify this, create a file that exports shims for the globals you need:

```ts
// @filename: src/shim.node.ts
export { Blob } from "buffer";
export { webcrypto as crypto } from "crypto";

export { fetch, File, FormData, Headers, Request, Response } from "undici";
export { Deno } from "@deno/shim-deno";
export { alert, confirm, prompt } from "@deno/shim-prompts";
```

Then, register your shims in [`tsconfig.json`], so `deno2node` can import them
where needed:

```jsonc
// @filename: tsconfig.json
{
  "deno2node": {
    "shim": "src/shim.node.ts" // path to shim file, relative to tsconfig
  }
}
```

### Runtime-specific code

In same cases you may want to have two different implementations, depending on
whether you're running on Deno or on Node. When shimming is not enough, you can
provide a Node-specific `<anything>.node.ts` and a Deno-specific
`<anything>.deno.ts` version of any file. They need to reside next to each other
in the same directory.

`deno2node` will ignore the Deno version and rewrite imports to use the Node.js
version instead. Thus, the Deno-specific file will not be part of the build
output.

For example, provide `greet.deno.ts` for Deno:

```ts
// @filename: src/greet.deno.ts
export function greet() {
  console.log("Hello Deno!");
  // access Deno-specific APIs here
}
```

Now, provide `greet.node.ts` for Node:

```ts
// @filename: src/greet.node.ts
export function greet() {
  console.log("Hello Node!");
  // access Node-specific APIs here
}
```

Finally, use it in `foo.ts`:

```ts
import { greet } from "./platform.deno.ts";

// Prints "Hello Deno!" on Deno,
// and "Hello Node!" on Node:
greet();
```

This technique has many uses. `deno2node` itself uses it to import from
https://deno.land/x. The Telegram bot framework [`grammY`] uses it to abstract
away platform-specific APIs.

### Vendoring

To import a module which has no npm equivalent, first set up `vendorDir`.

```jsonc
// @filename: tsconfig.json
{
  "deno2node": {
    "vendorDir": "src/vendor/" // path within `rootDir`
  }
}
```

Then, populate it: `deno vendor src/deps.vendor.ts --output src/vendor/`.

Vendoring is still experimental, so be welcome to open an issue if you encounter
a problem with it!

Also, consider recommending [`pnpm`] to users of your library. It might be able
to deduplicate vendored files across packages.

## API

Confer the automatically generated [API Reference] if you want to use
`deno2node` from code.

## Testing

Register tests via `"node:test"`, and build them alongside the source.

Then, test with `deno test src/` _and_ `node --test lib/`.

## Contributing

`npm it` to install dependencies, build, and test the project.

`git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks/` to build before each commit.
